The first thing that I would do is tell my boss, and make sure to emphasize the severity of the security problems. I believe that the best way to go about doing this would be to draft a document that justifies the delay by outlining the security issues and how they put occupants in danger. If my boss is unwilling to listen, I would then circumvent my boss and go to his/her higher-ups. This may be seen as disrespectful to the so-called “chain of command”, but the severity of the issue warrants it. If at that point, the higher-ups are still unwilling to postpone the release, I would take it upon myself to alert the public and/or a consumer watchdog. The severity of the security issues warrants public knowledge if the company is unwilling to postpone the release. At this point, the company would be intentionally putting customers in danger for the sake of profits. If I knew about the issue and chose not to act, I would be responsible for any resulting harm. This issue is analogous to the mistakes that Boeing made in regards to the recent 737 MAX malfunctions. Boeing knew after the first crash that the plane had a crucial malfunction that would cause it to go into a steep dive. However, Boeing refused to stop production of the plane and denied that any malfunction existed until about six months later when another crash occurred, killing 157 passengers. Boeing’s failure to act places them at the root cause of those deaths.
